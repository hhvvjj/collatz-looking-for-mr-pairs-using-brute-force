# Looking for mr Pairs Using Brute Force

A high-performance parallel C program for discovering unique `mr` values in Collatz sequences using the tuple-based transform.

## Features

This program analyzes Collatz sequences to find the first repeated value in the transformed sequence of `m` parameters. For each positive integer `n`, it computes the Collatz sequence and applies the transformation `m = (c - p) / 2` where `p = 2` if `c` is even, `p = 1` if `c` is odd. The first repeated `m` value in this sequence is called `mr`.

- **High Performance**: Optimized parallel implementation using OpenMP
- **Real-time Discovery**: Shows unique `mr` values as they are discovered
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Automatically chooses optimal work distribution strategy
- **Memory Efficient**: Dynamic memory allocation with intelligent growth
- **Large Scale**: Supports analysis up to 2^64 numbers
- **Thread Safe**: Lock-optimized concurrent access to shared data structures

## Research Background

By analyzing the m parameters derived from each step using the tuple-based transform on a Collatz sequence, we can identify patterns in how numbers "approach" the final cycle. The mr values represent the first repeated elements in these sequences, providing insight into the internal structure of Collatz dynamics.
Only a finite number of unique mr values exist, with all discoveries occurring within relatively small bounds (n â‰¤ 7287). This finding has implications for understanding the global behavior of Collatz sequences and provides pathways towards convergence patterns.
This brute-force approach serves as both a verification tool for theoretical bounds and a discovery mechanism for identifying the complete set of possible mr values across different ranges of starting values of n.

## Algorithm Details

### Core Algorithm
1. **Sequence Generation**: Standard 3n+1 Collatz sequence
2. **Transformation**: Apply m = (c-p)/2 for each step
3. **Repetition Detection**: Track all m values until first repetition
4. **Optimization**: Early termination for long sequences likely going to trivial cycle

### Parallel Strategy
- **Work Distribution**: Adaptive scheduling (static/guided/dynamic)
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-optimized unique value detection
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation with intelligent growth
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time discovery reporting
